Abstract:
Accurate estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics. This study leverages high-resolution UAV-derived data, including spectral indices (e.g., NDVI), LiDAR-derived metrics, and topographic information, to model and map herbaceous and woody biomass across the diverse Peneda-Gerês National Park in Portugal. Systematic field sampling was integrated with UAV data to develop generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) for predicting biomass. Land-use, elevation, slope, and aspect significantly influenced biomass across different plant categories. Model performance varied, with the total biomass model exhibiting strong within-sample fit (R² = 0.74) but moderate predictive accuracy in cross-validation (R²_20 = 0.30, RMSE_20 = 177.76 g/m²). The shrub biomass model showed comparable performance (R² = 0.73, R²_20 = 0.35, RMSE_20 = 167.30 g/m²). The forb, grass, and herbaceous biomass models demonstrated moderate to strong within-sample fit with varying levels of predictive accuracy. The total biomass model predicted an average of 119.57 g/m², with the highest values in high shrub habitats (209.69 g/m²) and the lowest in oak forests (62.21 g/m²). The shrub biomass model exhibited similar patterns, with the highest predicted biomass in high shrub habitats and the lowest in oak forests. The herbaceous biomass model predicted an average of 14.44 g/m², with the highest values in agricultural areas and the lowest in oak forests. All models demonstrated varying levels of uncertainty across habitats, with the highest coefficient of variation observed in agricultural patches for shrub biomass. The model effectively captured habitat-specific relationships, improving model performance. Future research should focus on expanding temporal and spatial coverage by integrating multi-temporal UAV data, incorporating data from multiple years and sites, and exploring the integration of UAV data with satellite imagery to improve model generalizability and scalability for broader environmental monitoring applications.
